<p>A single peak in the frequency domain corresponds to a single damped
oscillating wave in the time domain. If there are two peaks in the
frequency domain, then the time domain signal should show evidence of
both peaks. You can use the controls on the right to explore the
relationship between two Gaussian peaks in the frequency domain and
their corresponding contributions to the time domain signal. By default,
both peaks are included in the frequency domain spectrum and in the time
domain spectrum; you may, however, use the radio buttons to isolate the
individual peaks and their individual time domain signals.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> The default inputs create two peaks with
identical widths and areas. The first peak is centered at a frequency of
<span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> and the second peak at a
frequency of <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>. Examine the time
domain spectrum and explain how its pattern is similar to and different
from that for a system with a single peak with a frequency of <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Make a prediction for what you will see
in the frequency domain and in the time domain if a system has two peaks
with the same position (<span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>), the
same width (<span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>), and the same area
(<span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>). Adjust the sliders to create
this system and then evaluate your prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Adjust the sliders so peak 1 has a
position of <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>, a width of 5, and
an area of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, and so peak 2 has a
position of <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>, a width of 5, and
an area of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. Predict how the time
domain spectrum will change if you adjust both peaks to a width of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and then evaluate your prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Adjust the sliders for peak 1 to a
position of <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>, a width of 5, and
an area of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, and adjust the
sliders for peak 2 to a position of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>, a width of 5, and an area of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. Working in steps of +1 or +2 along
the frequency axis, adjust the position of peak 1 from <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> and describe how the time domain
spectrum changes.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5.</strong> What do you think the time domain
spectrum will look like if there are more than two peaks in the
frequency domain?</p>
