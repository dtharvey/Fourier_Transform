<p>The ability to represent a signal in the time domain or in the
frequency domain is general and applies to both periodic functions, such
as the continuously repeating square wave from the introduction, or a
non-periodic function, such as a peak in an NMR spectrum. The controls
on the right allow you to explore the relationship between a peak in the
frequency domain and its corresponding oscillating signal in the time
domain.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. A peak in the frequency domain is
defined by three variables: its position on the frequency axis, its
width at half of its maximum height, and its area. The corresponding
time domain signal is an oscillating wave defined by three properties:
its period, its amplitude, and its decay rate. Annotate the figure on
the right to show each of these six variables.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Absorption bands in molecular UV/Vis
spectroscopy are often modeled as Gaussian peaks. Use the pop-up menu to
select a Gaussian peak and use the sliders to observe how each of the
three variable’s that define the peak in the frequency domain affect the
three properties of the oscillating signal in the time domain. You
should be able to establish a 1:1 correspondence between each of the
peak’s variables and the oscillating signal’s properties.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> In NMR spectroscopy, the ideal peak
shape is Lorentzian. Use the controls on the right to examine the
difference between the shape of a Lorentzian peak and the shape of a
Gaussian peak that has the same position, width, and area. Are the
relationships between the time domain and the frequency domain the same
for both types of peaks?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> In atomic spectroscopy, emission peaks
often have a shape—called a Voigt peak—intermediate between a Gaussian
peak and a Lorentzian peak. Use the controls on the right to examine the
difference between the shape of a Voigt peak and the shape of a Gaussian
or Lorentzian peak that has the same position, width, and area. Are the
relationships between the time domain and the frequency domain the same
for all three types of peaks?</p>
