<h4>FT of Diffuse Reflectance Spectrum</h4>
<p>Our treatment of Fourier transforms in this module is limited to a
system with just one or two ideal peaks as this allowed us to explore
the relationship between a peak’s position in the frequency domain and
its oscillation period in the time domain, a peak’s width in the
frequency domain and its decay rate in the time domain, and a peak’s
area in the frequency domain and its intensity in the time domain. A
more complex spectrum—one with multiple peaks in the frequency
domain—results in a more complex pattern of oscillating waves in the
time domain. The figure on the upper right, for example, shows a portion
of the diffuse reflectance infrared (DRIFT) spectrum for urea and, on
the lower right, a portion of its time domain spectrum following a
Fourier transform.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-domains-and-frequency-domains" class="section level4">
<h4>Time Domains and Frequency Domains</h4>
<p>In the figure on the right—and in the examples considered in this
module—the frequency domain is a set of non-periodic peaks and the time
domain is an oscillating signal whose amplitude decays over time. For
the DRIFT spectrum on the right, collected using a Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer (FT–IR), the measured signal is the time domain
spectrum on the lower right, which is then converted into the frequency
domain spectrum by applying the Fourier transform. For other analytical
methods, the peaks appear in the time domain and the corresponding
frequency domain is obtained by applying the Fourier transform.</p>

<h4>Data Set Used in this Module</h4>
<p>The data for the urea’s diffuse reflectance spectrum is from the <a href="https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C57136&amp;Type=IR-SPEC&amp;Index=1#IR-SPEC">National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>. The original data
gives the intensity of reflected light for 7135 wavenumbers from
approximately <span class="math inline">\(7500\)</span> cm<sup>–1</sup>
to <span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> cm<sup>–1</sup>, and stored
in JCAMP-DX format with an extension of .jdx (JCAMP is the Joint
Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data). The data was extracted
from the .jdx file using the <code>R</code> package
<code>readJDX</code>, trimmed to <span class="math inline">\(4096\)</span> points from approximately <span class="math inline">\(4550\)</span> cm<sup>–1</sup> to approximately
<span class="math inline">\(600\)</span> <sup>–1</sup>, and stored in
.csv format. The Fourier transformation of the data used
<code>R</code>’s <code>fft()</code> function. (<em>Why 4096 points? The
mathematics behind the Fourier transform requires that the number of
data points be a power of 2; 4096 is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(2^{12}\)</span></em>)</p>
<p>Gaussian peaks in the frequency domain were created in <code>R</code>
using the <code>dnorm()</code> function <span class="math display">\[\text{intensity = area} \times \text{dnorm(x,
position, width/2.35)}\]</span> where area, position, and width are the
values set by the slider inputs, where <em>x</em> is a vector of
frequencies, and where width is divided by 2.35 to convert the width at
half height to a standard deviation.</p>
<p>Lorentzian peaks in the frequency domain were created in
<code>R</code> using the code <span class="math display">\[\text{intensity = area} \times \frac{1}{\pi}
\times \frac{0.5 \times \text{width}}{(\text{x}-\text{position})^2 +
(0.5 \times \text{width})^2}\]</span> where area, position, and width
are the values set by the slider inputs, and where <em>x</em> is a
vector of frequencies.</p>
<p>The Voigt peaks for a given area, position, and width are
approximated as a 50:50 mixture of the corresponding Gaussian and
Lorentzian peaks.</p>
