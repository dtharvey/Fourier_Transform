<p>The Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that allows us
to take a signal recorded in one measurement domain (perhaps time) and
convert it into a complementary signal in another measurement domain
(perhaps frequency).</p>
<div id="time-domains-and-frequency-domains" class="section level4">
<h4>Time Domains and Frequency Domains</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is a square wave with amplitude shown
on the <em>y</em>-axis and time shown on the <em>x</em>-axis. The square
wave has a period of 1 sec, a frequency of 1 sec<sup>-1</sup>, and an
amplitude that varies between <span class="math inline">\(\pm
1\)</span>. The figure shows two full periods and continues in both
directions along the <em>x</em>-axis. This is the time domain
representation of a square wave.</p>
<p>The middle figure shows the same square wave expressed as a series of
sine waves, called a Fourier series. Each vertical line defines a sine
wave by its amplitude, which are the heights of the vertical lines
(shown above each line), and by its frequency, which are the positions
of the vertical lines along the <em>x</em>-axis. The figure shows the
first 10 sine waves of an infinite series defined as <span class="math display">\[y(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k = 1}^{5}
\frac{1}{2k-1} sin \left( 2\pi(2k-1)t \right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is an index for the sine wave <span class="math inline">\((k = 1, 2, 3, \dots \infty)\)</span>. The first
sine wave, for example, has an amplitude, <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, of 1.273 and a frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>, of 1; each subsequent sine wave has
an amplitude equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A_1}{2k-1}\)</span> and a frequency equal to
<span class="math inline">\(f_1 \times (2k-1)\)</span>. This is the
frequency domain representation of the square wave shown on the upper
right.</p>

<div id="moving-between-domains" class="section level4">
<h4>Moving Between Domains</h4>
<p>Although the figure on the top right clearly is a square wave, it
isnâ€™t obvious that the series of amplitudes and frequencies in the
middle figure is equivalent to the square wave. The figure on the lower
right shows the first five sine waves in this Fourier series as dashed
lines. The sum of these five sine waves is the solid, sky-blue line.
Although five sine waves is not sufficient to reproduce exactly the
square wave shown by the black, dashed line, including more sine waves
will provide a better approximation.</p>
