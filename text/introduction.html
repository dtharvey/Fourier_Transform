transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that takes a signal in one
measurement domain and converts it into a signal in another measurement
domain.</p>

<h4>Time Domains and Frequency Domains</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is a square wave with amplitude on the
<em>y</em>-axis and time on the <em>x</em>-axis. The square wave has a
period of 1 s, a frequency of 1 s<sup>-1</sup>, and an amplitude that
varies between <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>. The figure
shows two full periods. This is the time domain.</p>
<p>The middle figure describes the square wave as a series of sine
waves, called a Fourier series. Each vertical line defines a sine wave
by its amplitude—the height of the vertical line—and its frequency,
which is the vertical line’s position on the <em>x</em>-axis. The figure
shows the first 10 sine waves of an infinite series defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k = 1}^{5}
\frac{1}{2k-1} sin \left( 2\pi(2k-1)t \right)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is an index for the sine
wave <span class="math inline">\((k = 1, 2, 3, \dots \infty)\)</span>.
The first sine wave has an amplitude, <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, of 1.273 and a frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span>, of 1; each subsequent sine wave has
an amplitude equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A_1}{2k-1}\)</span> and a frequency equal to
<span class="math inline">\(f_1 \times (2k-1)\)</span>. This is the
frequency domain.</p>

<h4>Moving Between Domains</h4>
<p>Although the figure on the top right clearly is a square wave, it
isn’t obvious that the Fourier series in the middle figure is equivalent
to a square wave. The figure on the lower right shows the first five
sine waves as dashed lines. The sum of these sine waves is the solid,
sky-blue line. Although five sine waves is not sufficient to reproduce
exactly a square wave—the black, dashed line—including more sine waves
provides a better approximation.</p>
