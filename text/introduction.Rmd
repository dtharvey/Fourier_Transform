The Fourier transform (FT) is mathematical operation that allows us to take a signal recorded in one measurement domain (perhaps time) and convert it into a complementary signal in another measurement domain (perhaps frequency), as illustrated here.

#### Time Domains and Frequency Domains

The figure on the upper right is a square wave with amplitude on the *y*-axis and time on the *x*-axis. The square wave has a period of 1 sec, a frequency of 1 sec^-1^, and an amplitude that varies between $\pm 1$. The figure shows two full periods and continues in both directions along the *x*-axis. This is the time domain representation of a square wave. 

The middle figure shows the same square wave as a series of sine waves whose amplitudes are the heights of the vertical lines (shown above each line) and whose frequencies are the positions of the vertical lines along the *x*-axis. The figure shows the first 10 sine waves of an infinite series. The first sine wave has an amplitude, $A_1$, of 1.273 and a frequency, $f_1$, of 1; each subsequent sine wave has an amplitude equal to $\frac{A_1}{2k-1}$ and a frequency equal to $f_1 \times (2k-1)$ where $k$ is an index for the sine wave $(k = 1, 2, 3, \dots \infty)$. This is the frequency domain representation of a square wave.

#### Moving Between Domains

Although the figure on the top right clearly is a square wave, it isn't obvious that the series of lines in the middle figure is equivalent to a square wave. If we express the first five sine waves as a Fourier series in which the amplitude, $y(t)$, of the square wave at any time is a sum of these five sine waves
$$y(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k = 1}^{5} \frac{1}{2k-1} sin \left( 2\pi(2k-1)t \right)$$
then we obtain the figure on the bottom right, which shows the square wave as a dashed black line, the five individual sine waves as dashed blue lines, and the sum of these five sine waves as the solid blue line. Although five sine waves is not sufficient to reproduce the square wave, it is clear that including more sine waves will provide a better approximation.
