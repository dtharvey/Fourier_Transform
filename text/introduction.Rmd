$\require{mhchem}$The Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that takes a signal in one measurement domain and converts it into a  signal in another measurement domain.

#### Time Domains and Frequency Domains

The figure on the upper right is a square wave with amplitude on the *y*-axis and time on the *x*-axis. The square wave has a period of 1 s, a frequency of 1 s^-1^, and an amplitude that varies between $\pm 1$. The figure shows two full periods. This is the time domain. 

The middle figure describes the square wave as a series of sine waves, called a Fourier series. Each vertical line defines a sine wave by its amplitude---the height of the vertical line---and its frequency, which is the vertical line's position on the *x*-axis. The figure shows the first 10 sine waves of an infinite series defined as 

$$y(t) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k = 1}^{5} \frac{1}{2k-1} sin \left( 2\pi(2k-1)t \right)$$

where $k$ is an index for the sine wave $(k = 1, 2, 3, \dots \infty)$. The first sine wave has an amplitude, $A_1$, of 1.273 and a frequency, $f_1$, of 1; each subsequent sine wave has an amplitude equal to $\frac{A_1}{2k-1}$ and a frequency equal to $f_1 \times (2k-1)$. This is the frequency domain.

#### Moving Between Domains

Although the figure on the top right clearly is a square wave, it isn't obvious that the Fourier series in the middle figure is equivalent to a square wave. The figure on the lower right shows the first five sine waves as dashed lines. The sum of these sine waves is the solid, sky-blue line. Although five sine waves is not sufficient to reproduce exactly a square wave---the black, dashed line---including more sine waves provides a better approximation.
