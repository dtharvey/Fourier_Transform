# Fourier_Transform
 
Students are introduced to the Fourier transform with particular attention to the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain for a simple system consisting of a single Gaussian, Lorentzian, or Voigt peak, or two Gaussian peaks.

To run locally, install the package Shiny (if not already installed), and enter the following two lines into the console:
